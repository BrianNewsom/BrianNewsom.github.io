Merry Christmas to all!  Just wanted to quickly update you as to what was going on with this site.

# Why does this even exist?

This site is simply a much needed personal website.  I started out looking around some people’s websites and determining
what I liked and what I didn’t.  Simplicity pointed me towards [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) - which has been a really
cool tool to work with.  I found a website created by github user rsms on Jekyll’s website and have built my based upon his.
It’s very flawed and not even close to complete, but I’m working on getting some content up now so it’s not just mindless
building of a website (I’ve never been great at UI).

# What will be here?

I’d love to include some of my adventures in programming, quick tutorials in working with technologies that I’m learning
for both my own use and hopefully others.  Additionally, once I finally get some of my own music up, I will post in on this
site for your consumption.  I will be up to date with Hackathons I attend, projects I complete, etc. and hopefully you 
will be entertained if only slightly.

That’s all for now - happy holidays to all and I can’t wait to expand this blog.

-Brian
