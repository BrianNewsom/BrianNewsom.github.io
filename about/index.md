My name is Brian Newsom.  I am a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
In my free time you’ll find me playing musical instruments, ice hockey, or programming for fun.
I am interested in bitcoin, web design, algorithm design, optimization, numerical simulations, and so many other things.
